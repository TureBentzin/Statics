ItÂ´s small - it works. 

## Usage

Download from hangar (or fetch with nix):
https://hangar.papermc.io/TureBentzin/Statics

## Configuration
The configuration is done via the `config.yml` file. The default configuration is as follows:

```yaml
placeholders:
   demo: "<rainbow>Statics works!</rainbow>"
```
It should be self explanatory.
You can use the following command to test if statics is working:
```
/miniplaceholders parse me <statics_demo>
```
